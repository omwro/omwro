## Hello World! Welcome to my coding corner! 👋
You are currently looking at the GitHub page of an **upcoming** 
Full Stack Web Developer that **will** shake the **world**! But
why should you believe me? Well... You shouldn't. You should
instead take a look at my projects and let the code speak for itself.

My name is Omer Erdem and I use Github to store my hobby projects, work with groups and archive
my previous school projects / assignments. I do a bit of everything like:
- 🕸️ Frontend Website
- ⛓ Backend API's
- 🤖 Bots & Scripts
- 🎮 Game Development
- 📱 Mobile Development
- 💻 Application Development
- 🦾 Plugin & Package Development  
- 💾 Database Designs
- 📊 Data Science
- ️🛠️ Server Management

### Code I'm most proud of 😎:
```
private static int stringSize(String string) {
  int size = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++) {
    size = size + 1;
  }
  return size;
}
```
